## 📂 Dataset Information

The analysis is based on publicly available Olympic datasets:

* **athlete_events.csv**
  Contains athlete-level information such as name, gender, age, sport, event, year, and medal.

* **noc_regions.csv**
  Maps National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes to country/region names.

The dataset spans **multiple Olympic years, countries, sports, and athletes**.
